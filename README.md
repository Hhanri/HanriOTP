## General Information
- HanriOTP is a One Time Password (OTP) generator application for 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) that I made as one of my main Portfolio app with Flutter, it was made to replace any OTP application such as Google's with a light weight, optimized app and that doesn't need to connect to the internet. In sum it is a very simple OTP generator app, it doesn't do anything superficial, just straight to the point.
